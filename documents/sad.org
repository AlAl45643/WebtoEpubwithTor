2) Modifying the retrieved links by removing specific items
3) Exporting the retrieved links to an epub

A special but common runtime view would be a website requesting a captcha to access its contents. It would need to be handled by:
1) Detecting that a captcha has been requested
2) Sending the captcha to the user to solve

* Cross-cutting Concepts
** Cloudflare
The key problem in creating any webscraper is bypassing site protections that prevent scrapers from accessing a site. These site protections are typically implemented by content delivery networks (CDN). One popular CDN is Cloudflare which connects approximately 10% of all websites.

Cloudflare detects bots with a multitude of methods including but not limited to TLS Fingerprinting, HTTP/2 Fingerprint, Canvas Fingerprinting, Captchas, and Browser specific api. With so many methods used it questions how our webscraper will function?

To bypass such methods we need to identify the common link between them, which is that all of these methods try to separate user action and computer automated action. So, in order to bypass such protections we must follow two principles.

+ Emulate user browsing behavior
+ Fallback to the user when we are stumped

Cloudflare Fallback Behavior: 
file:../tests/TestingSeleniumedTorBrowser.cs::95

** Tor Relays
Achieving our anonymity quality requires us to implement measures when accessing the web. These measures include using Tor Relays to access webpages.

Tor Relays achieve anonymity by encrypting messages in multiple layers to be decrypted by selective computers in a chain. Each message goes through an:
1) Guard node, which knows the originator but not the message as its encrypted
2) Middle node, which knows the guard node but neither the originator or the message
3) Exit node, which knows the message and middle node but not the originator

To acquire these benefits the WET shall always use Tor Relays to access webpages.

| Context      | Anonymity is to know an action but not who is comitting it. To not know who is committing but know what they are comitting requires that each action an anonymous person commits could possibly be done by someone else. We can accept this as true if we consider the opposite situation, if an action can only be done by one person then every time such an action is performed we could easily identify who is performing it. Furthermore, the fewer someone elses there are, the more unique we become, and the less anonymous we shall be. So, how do we ensure that our actions are identityless i.e. anonymous? |
| Decision     | To ensure we are identityless we must adopt similar traits to others and hide our real-world identities. Our solution is to use the Tor Browser which with Tor Relays ensures that the servers we access do not know the sender, and a browser that obfusicates between its users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Consequences | Will increase the anonymity quality of the user; Web automation tools may not support or easily support our configuration; May increase the chances of encountering Site Protections from Cloudflare compared to normal browsing; Will increase the required setup for the system on the user's end; Will make emulating a user browser environment easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Context      | Browsers are a necessary component in bypassing bot protections as they are typical in a user environment. Emulating the user environment should not hinder functionality so the browser should be automated. Furthermore, any such tool should be compatible with C# and the Tor Browser. |
| Decision     | The Selenium browser is a popular solution that can be set up to imitate an user browsing environment, compatible with the Tor Browser, and has a C# API.                                                                                           |

| Context      | Sites that seperate related content into multiple webpages will usually reference them within one main webpage. For example, a webnovel will reference its chapters in a table of contents page or a wiki may organize its articles into a map of content page. Our software's purpose is to aggregate these seperate but related webpages into an epub. |
| Decision     | To take advantage we must design our piece of software to look for hyperlinks according to a pattern within a main webpage and aggregate these referenced webpages together.                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Context      | The EPUB format is a zipped XHTML, CSS, and any images and fonts files with a .epub extension. Webpages on the internet are formatted in .html. XHTML is a stricter version of HTML where improper formatting is not ignored as it is with HTML. Even with improper formatting HTML will still display in browsers while XHTML will not. |
| Decision     | In order to convert HTML to XHTML and parse HTML pages for links the AngleSharp parser will be used within this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Context      | The EPUB format is a zipped XHTML, CSS, and any images and fonts files with a .epub extension. Webpages on the internet are formatted in .html. XHTML is a stricter version of HTML where improper formatting is not ignored as it is with HTML. Even with improper formatting HTML will still display in browsers while XHTML will not. Selenium can retrieve visible text from a webpage. |
| Decision     | Convert HTML to XHTML by retrieving the visible text in a webpage and programatically creating a xhtml file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Status       | Accepted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Consequences | Will allow us to create epubs; Will convert XHTML correctly everytime; Will increase creating Epub wait time;

| W01 | A user plans to download the top 10 novels from [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series-ranking/][novelupdates.]] He is able to download atleast 7 of the top 10 novels using the WET.                                                                                                                                       |
| W02 | A recruiter with basic knowledge of UML looks for an overview on the implementation of the WET. He understands the overall design of this WET within 15 minutes using this document.                                                                                     |
| W03 | An open source developer is looking for a code example to implement his own web scraper. He is able to find a test case that displays the WET's functionality in an understandable manner.                                                                               |
| W04 | A potential user is looking for an anonymous alternative to common web to epub aggregators, he finds that the WET meet his requirements. The user uses the WET and finds that all of his requests were done through TOR ensuring that his epubs are created anonymously. |

* Risks and Technical Debts
** TR1: Stricter Bot Protections
Description: Cloudflare and other CDNs change their bot detection tools regularly so what may work today may not work tomorrow.

Mitigation: The Retrieve Requests Blackbox should be implemented first and documented with test cases so as to identify and reimplement functionality promptly.
** TR2: TOR Blocked
Description: The TOR network may be blocked in the users' area.

Mitigation: Enable bridges for Tor Browser when necessary.
** TR3: Improper XHTML
Description: Even if HTML is improper it is still rendered by the browser while XHTML must have proper syntax. When converting HTML to XHTML it is possible that the converted XHTML is invalid due to broken syntax.

Mitigation: Use a manual HTML to XHTML method that ensures Html is always converted properly.
